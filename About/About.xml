This mod adds a new power generator to the game. An RTG (Radioisotope thermoelectric generator). It uses Uranium as part of it's building requirement and produces a steady amount of power at all times. It produces 750w of power.
Since it is an RTG, it also produces heat. You'll need to keep the room it is in cool otherwise it will cause fires.
This mod also adds an ASRG (Advanced Stirling radioisotope generator). It requires a heck of a lot of research. It produces 1500w of power.
